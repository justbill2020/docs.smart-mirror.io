# Install dependencies and run

Before we can run the thing we've got to install the projects dependencies. From the root of the `smart-mirror` directory run:
```
npm install
```

This will take a minute, it has to download [electron-prebuilt](https://github.com/mafintosh/electron-prebuilt). Once that's done you can launch the mirror with
```
npm start
```
